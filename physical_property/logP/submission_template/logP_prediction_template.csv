#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit water to octanol (ΔG_octanol - ΔG_water) transfer free energy (TFE) predictions for all 22 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# The energy units must be in kcal/mol.
# Please report TFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and TFE model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, TFE, TFE SEM, TFE model uncertainty
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.
Predictions:



# NAME SECTION
#
# Please provide an informal but informative name of the method used.
# The name must not exceed 40 characters.
# The 'Name:' keyword is required as shown here.
Name:


# COMPUTE TIME SECTION
#
# Please provide the average compute time across all of the molecules.
# For physical methods, report the GPU and/or CPU compute time in hours.
# For empirical methods, report the query time in hours.
# The 'Compute time:' keyword is required as shown here.
