# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit  water to octanol (ΔG_octanol - ΔG_water) transfer free energy (TFE) predictions for all 22 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# The energy units must be in kcal/mol.
# Please report TFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and TFE model uncertainty.
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, TFE, TFE SEM, TFE model uncertainty
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.
