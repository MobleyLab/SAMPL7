## SAMPL7 log *P* Prediction Challenge

The SAMPL7 log *P* Challenge consists of predicting the octanol-water partition coefficients of 22 molecules. Our aim is to evaluate how well current models can capture the transfer free energy of small molecules between different solvent environments through blind predictions. Challenge participants will be asked to predict the difference in free energy for the neutral form between water and octanol. This challenge is *optional* and will be run at the same time as the pK<sub>a</sub> and permeability challenge (both of which are also optional).  

Detailed instructions and a submission template for the log *P* challenge will be posted at a later time.

Experimental log *P* measurements will made available after the challenge deadline.
