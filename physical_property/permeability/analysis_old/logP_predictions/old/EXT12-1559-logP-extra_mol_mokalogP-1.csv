# PREDICTION SECTION 
# 
# It is mandatory to submit logP predictions for all 11 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted. 
# Please report logP standard error of the mean (SEM) and logP model uncertainty.  
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows: 
# Molecule ID, logP, logP SEM, logP model uncertainty 
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.
