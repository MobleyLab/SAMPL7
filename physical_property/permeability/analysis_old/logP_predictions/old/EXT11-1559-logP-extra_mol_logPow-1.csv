# PREDICTION SECTION 
# 
# It is mandatory to submit logP predictions for all 11 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted. 
# Please report logP standard error of the mean (SEM) and logP model uncertainty.  
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows: 
# Molecule ID, logP, logP SEM, logP model uncertainty 
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

Method: 
The logP values were calculated with moe2019.01.01 from Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada (https://www.chemcomp.com)
logP(o/w) calculated from a ~100 parameter linear atom type model with r2 = 0.931, RMSE=0.393 on 1,827 molecules.
