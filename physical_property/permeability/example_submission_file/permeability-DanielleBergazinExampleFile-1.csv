# PERMEABILITY PREDICTIONS
#
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements:
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit permeability predictions for all 22 molecules.
# Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
#
# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SMXX` (e.g. SM25, SM26, etc).
# Please indicate the microstate(s) used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section (e.g. `SM25_mol000`, `SM26_mol000 SM26_ext001`)
# Please report apparent permeability coefficient (logPapp) standard error of the mean (SEM) and logPapp model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas), logPapp, logPapp SEM, logPapp model uncertainty
#
# Your logPapp predictions do NOT have to use the challenge provided molecules in the `SAMPL7_molecule_ID_and_SMILES.csv` file.
# If you use a microstate other than the one listed in the challenge provided files, please fill out the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section using a molecule ID in the form of `SMXX_ext001` (number can vary) and please list the molecule ID and it's SMILES string in your methods description in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION`.
#
# Only one entry in the second column (`Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)`) is required, but you should list all IDs considered/input to your calculations. See challenge instructions.
#
# If you have evaluated additional microstates then the molecule ID used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section needs to be in the format: `SMXX_ext001` (number can vary).
# If multiple microstates are used, please report the order of population in the aqueous phase in descending order.
# Please list microstate populations, SMILES strings and the molecule IDs in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION` section further below.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

# COMPUTE TIME SECTION
#
# Please provide the average compute time across all of the molecules.
# For physical methods, report the GPU and/or CPU compute time in hours.
# For empirical methods, report the query time in hours.
# Create a new line for each processor type.
# The 'Compute time:' keyword is required as shown here.
Compute time:

#
# COMPUTING AND HARDWARE SECTION
#
# Please provide details of the computing resources that were used to train models and make predictions.
# Please specify compute time for training models and querying separately for empirical prediction methods.
# Provide a detailed description of the hardware used to run the simulations.
# The 'Computing and hardware:' keyword is required as shown here.
Computing and hardware:
All the simulations were performed on two GeForce GTX 1080 on a single machine hosting an Intel Xeon Processor E5-2697 v4.
The replicas were divided into two sets of the same size and propagated in parallel on the two GPUs, while the exchange
stage was performed serially. We estimate the total wall-clock time spent doing parallel/serial work to be
approximately 95%/5% respectively.

# Create a new line for each software.
# The 'Software:' keyword is required.

# METHOD CATEGORY SECTION
#
# State which method category your prediction method is better described as:
# `Physical (MM)`, `Physical (QM)`, `Empirical`, or `Mixed`.
# Pick only one category label.
# The `Category:` keyword is required.
Category:

# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION
#

# Please include the values of key parameters with units.
# Please explain how statistical uncertainties were estimated.
#
# If you have evaluated additional microstates, please report their SMILES strings and populations of all the microstates in this section.
# If you used a microstate other than the challenge provided microstate found in the `SAMPL7_molecule_ID_and_SMILES.csv` file, please list your chosen molecule ID (in the form of `SMXX_extra001`) along with the SMILES string in your methods description.
#
