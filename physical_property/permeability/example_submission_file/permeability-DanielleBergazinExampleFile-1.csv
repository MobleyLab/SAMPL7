# PERMEABILITY PREDICTIONS
#
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements:
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit permeability predictions for all 22 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# Please report apparent permeability coefficient (logPapp) standard error of the mean (SEM) and logPapp model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, logPapp, logPapp SEM, logPapp model uncertainty
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.
