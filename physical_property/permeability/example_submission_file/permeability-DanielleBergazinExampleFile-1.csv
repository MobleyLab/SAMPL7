# PERMEABILITY PREDICTIONS
#
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements:
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit permeability predictions for all 22 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# Please report apparent permeability coefficient (logPapp) standard error of the mean (SEM) and logPapp model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, logPapp, logPapp SEM, logPapp model uncertainty
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

#
# NAME SECTION
#
# Please provide an informal but informative name of the method used.
# The character limit for the name should not exceed 40 characters.
# The 'Name:' keyword is required as shown here.
Name:

#
#
# COMPUTE TIME SECTION
#
# Please provide the average compute time across all of the molecules.
# For physical methods, report the GPU and/or CPU compute time in hours.
# For empirical methods, report the query time in hours.
# Create a new line for each processor type.
# The 'Compute time:' keyword is required as shown here.
Compute time:
28 hours, CPU
5.5 hours, GPU

#
# COMPUTING AND HARDWARE SECTION
#
# Please provide details of the computing resources that were used to train models and make predictions.
# Please specify compute time for training models and querying separately for empirical prediction methods.
# Provide a detailed description of the hardware used to run the simulations.
# The 'Computing and hardware:' keyword is required as shown here.
Computing and hardware:
All the simulations were performed on two GeForce GTX 1080 on a single machine hosting an Intel Xeon Processor E5-2697 v4.
The replicas were divided into two sets of the same size and propagated in parallel on the two GPUs, while the exchange
stage was performed serially. We estimate the total wall-clock time spent doing parallel/serial work to be
approximately 95%/5% respectively.

# SOFTWARE SECTION
#
# List all major software packages used and their versions.
# Create a new line for each software.
# The 'Software:' keyword is required.
Software:
OpenMM 7.1.1
OpenMMTools 0.13.4
YANK 0.19.4

# METHOD CATEGORY SECTION
#
# State which method category your prediction method is better described as:
# `Physical (MM)`, `Physical (QM)`, `Empirical`, or `Mixed`.
# Pick only one category label.
# The `Category:` keyword is required.
Category:
Physical (MM)

# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION
#
# Methodology and computational details.
# Level of details should be roughly equivalent to that used in a publication.
# Please include the values of key parameters with units.
# Please explain how statistical uncertainties were estimated.
# Use as many lines of text as you need.
# All text following the 'Method:' keyword will be regarded as part of your free text methods description.
Method:
Free text methods section describing the approach and calculations in full detail.


#
#
# All submissions must either be ranked or non-ranked.
# Only one ranked submission per participant is allowed.
# Multiple ranked submissions from the same participant will not be judged.
# Non-ranked submissions are accepted so we can verify that they were made before the deadline.
# The "Ranked:" keyword is required, and expects a Boolean value (True/False)
Ranked:
True
