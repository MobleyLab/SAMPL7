## SAMPL7 PAMPA Permeability Prediction Challenge

The SAMPL7 PAMPA Permeability Challenge consists of predicting the permeabilities of 22 molecules. This challenge is *optional* and will be run at the same time as the pK<sub>a</sub> and partition coefficient challenge (both of which are also optional).

Detailed instructions and a submission template for the permeability challenge will be posted at a later time.

Experimental permeability data will made available after the challenge deadline.
