## SAMPL7 PAMPA Permeability Prediction Challenge

The SAMPL7 PAMPA Permeability Challenge consists of predicting the permeabilities of 22 molecules. This challenge is *optional* and will be run at the same time as the pK<sub>a</sub> and partition coefficient challenge (both of which are also optional).

Detailed instructions and a submission template for the permeability challenge will be posted at a later time. For who that start early, please note that permeabilities for compounds SM33, SM35, and SM39 were not determined.

Experimental permeability data will made available after the challenge deadline.

## Manifest
- `SAMPL7_molecule_ID_and_SMILES.csv` - A `.CSV` files containing SMILES strings. Additionally, the pK<sub>a</sub> challenge has [enumerated microstates for each molecule](physical_property/pKa/microstates/).
- [`/submission_template/permeability_prediction_template.csv`](/submission_template/permeability_prediction_template.csv) - An empty prediction submission template file.
- [`/example_submission_file/permeability-DanielleBergazinExampleFile-1.csv`](/example_submission_file/permeability-DanielleBergazinExampleFile-1.csv) - An example submission file filled with random values to illustrate expected format.
