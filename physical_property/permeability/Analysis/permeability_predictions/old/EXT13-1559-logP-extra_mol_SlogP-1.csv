# PREDICTION SECTION 
# 
# It is mandatory to submit logP predictions for all 11 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted. 
# Please report logP standard error of the mean (SEM) and logP model uncertainty.  
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows: 
# Molecule ID, logP, logP SEM, logP model uncertainty 
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

Method: 
The logP values were calculated with moe2019.01.01 from Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada (https://www.chemcomp.com)
The method is a re-implementation of the method described in 
Wildman, S.A., Crippen, G.M.; Prediction of Physiochemical Parameters by Atomic Contributions; J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 39 (1999) 868â€“873.
The training set for SlogP was ~7000 structures.
As the method does not return a SEM or model uncertainty, both values are set to zero.
