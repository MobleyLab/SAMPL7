# PREDICTION SECTION 
# 
# It is mandatory to submit logP predictions for all 11 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted. 
# Please report logP standard error of the mean (SEM) and logP model uncertainty.  
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows: 
# Molecule ID, logP, logP SEM, logP model uncertainty 
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

# NAME SECTION 
# 
# Please provide an informal but informative name of the method used.  
# The 'Name:' keyword is required as shown here. 
Name: 
clogP (Biobyte)
 
# SOFTWARE SECTION 
# 
# List all major software packages used and their versions. 
# Create a new line for each software. 
# The 'Software:' keyword is required. 
Software: 
Biobyte clogp-5.4
 
# METHOD CATEGORY SECTION 
# 
# State which method category your prediction method is better described as: 
# `Physical`, `Empirical`, `Mixed`, or `Other`. 
# Pick only one category label. 
# The `Category:` keyword is required. 
Category: 
Empirical

 
# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION 
# 
# Methodology and computational details. 
# Level of details should be roughly equivalent to that used in a publication. 
# Please include the values of key parameters with units. Please explain how statistical uncertainties were estimated. 
# Use as many lines of text as you need. 
# All text following the 'Method:' keyword will be regarded as part of your free text methods description. 
Method: 
The logP values were calculated by the program clogP by BioByte Corp., Claremont, CA 91711-4707. As no SEM or model uncertainty is reported, these values are set to zero.

The method is described in 
a) Leo, A., Chemical Reviews, 1993, 93, 1281.
b) Leo, A., J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II, 1983, 825.
c) Leo, A., The Science of the Total Environment, 1991, 109/110, 121.
