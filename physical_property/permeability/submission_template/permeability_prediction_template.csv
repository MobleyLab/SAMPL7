# PERMEABILITY PREDICTIONS
#
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements:
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit permeability predictions for all 22 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# Please report apparent permeability coefficient (logPapp) standard error of the mean (SEM) and logPapp model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Molecule ID, logPapp, logPapp SEM, logPapp model uncertainty
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.
Predictions:



# NAME SECTION
#
# Please provide an informal but informative name of the method used.
# The character limit for the name should not exceed 40 characters.
# The 'Name:' keyword is required as shown here.
Name:



# COMPUTE TIME SECTION
#
# Please provide the average compute time across all of the molecules.
# For physical methods, report the GPU and/or CPU compute time in hours.
# For empirical methods, report the query time in hours.
# The 'Compute time:' keyword is required as shown here.
Compute time:



# COMPUTING AND HARDWARE SECTION
#
# Please provide details of the computing resources that were used to train models and make predictions.
# Provide a detailed description of the hardware used.
# The 'Computing and hardware:' keyword is required as shown here.
Computing and hardware:



# SOFTWARE SECTION
#
# List all major software packages used and their versions.
# Create a new line for each software.
# The 'Software:' keyword is required.
Software:



# METHOD CATEGORY SECTION
#
# State which method category your prediction method is better described as:
# `Physical (MM)`, `Physical (QM)`, `Empirical`, or `Mixed`.
# Pick only one category label.
# The `Category:` keyword is required.
Category:



# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION
#
# Methodology and computational details.
# Level of details should be roughly equivalent to that used in a publication.
# Please include the values of key parameters with units.
# Please explain how statistical uncertainties were estimated.
# Use as many lines of text as you need.
# All text following the 'Method:' keyword will be regarded as part of your free text methods description.
