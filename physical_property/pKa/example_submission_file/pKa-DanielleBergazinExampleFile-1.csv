# RELATIVE FREE ENERGY PREDICTIONS (for pKa prediction)
#
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements:
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit relative free energy (RFE) predictions for all 22 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# Please report RFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and RFE model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Microstate ID of reference state, Microstate ID of the predicted microstate, total charge, RFE, RFE SEM, RFE model uncertainty
#
# If you have evaluated additional microstates, include the following:
# Microstate ID of reference state, Microstate ID of the predicted microstate, total charge, RFE, RFE SEM, RFE model uncertainty, SMILES string of the predicted microstate
#
# The molecule ID of the other microstate needs to be in the format: `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary)
# Also email us the `.mol2` file of your microstate with explicit hydrogens and correct bond orders,
# Please send the `.mol2` file to the email listed on the instructions page.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

# METHOD CATEGORY SECTION
#
# State if your prediction method is better classified as an
# experimental database lookup (DL), linear free energy relationship (LFER),
# quantitative structure-property relationship or machine learning (QSPR/ML),
# quantum mechanics without empirical correction (QM) model, quantum mechanics with
# linear empirical correction (QM+LEC), and combined quantum mechanics and molecular
# mechanics (QM+MM), or Other, using the following category labels:
# `DL`, `LFER`, `QSPR/ML`, `QM`, `QM+LEC`, `QM+MM` or `Other`.
#
# Pick only one category label.
# The `Category:` keyword is required.
Category:
QSPR/ML


# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION
#
# Methodology and computational details.
# Level of details should be roughly equivalent to that used in a publication.
# Please include the values of key parameters with units.
# Please explain how statistical uncertainties were estimated.
# Use as many lines of text as you need.
# All text following the 'Method:' keyword will be regarded as part of your free text methods description.
