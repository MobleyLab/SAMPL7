# SAMPL7 pK<sub>a</sub> Prediction Challenge

The SAMPL7 pK<sub>a</sub> Challenge consists of predicting relative free energies between microstates to determine the pK<sub>a</sub> of 22 molecules. Our aim is to evaluate how well current pK<sub>a</sub> prediction methods perform with these 22 molecules through blind predictions. Challenge participants will be asked to predict free energy differences between microstates at a specified pH. Challenge organizers will provide a reference microstate for each compound.

Detailed instructions and a submission template for the pK<sub>a</sub> challenge will be posted at a later time.

Experimental pK<sub>a</sub> measurements will made available after the challenge deadline.
