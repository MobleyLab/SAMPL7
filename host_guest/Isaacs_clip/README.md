# The SAMPL7 TrimerTrip Challenge

For SAMPL7, the Isaacs group is contributing binding data for roughly ten guests to a CB-like clip molecule highlighted in the attached documents. This host is codenamed TrimerTrip.

## Challenge timing details (preliminary)

Currently, as of May 1, 2019, the Isaacs group is trying to ensure a broad range of binding affinities and finalizing guest selection for roughly 10 guests, to be completed in the next two weeks or so.
Following this, the challenge is expected to launch around June 1, 2019, with experimental data potentially available for release as of August 1. Depending on calculation timescales a submission deadline may be set later than that, though input on this is welcome.
