# Guests for the SAMPL7 Cyclodextrin Derivatives Challenge

Guests are trans-3-methylcyclohexanol and R-rimantadine hydrochloride, codenamed `g1` and `g2` respectively.
Provided are the guests for this challenge in PDB (.pdb), MOL2 (.mol2), SDF (.sdf) and ChemDraw (.cdx) format.

## What's here

- `guests.txt` : Textfile containing the isomeric SMILES strings and ids/codenames for the guests.
- `guests.ism` : isomeric SMILES strings and ids for the guests.
- `guests.csv` : names and ids for the guests.
- `g1.mol2`, `g2.mol2` : Sybyl mol2 files for the guests, as provided by Katy Kellett on May 15, 2019.
- `guest_input_maker.ipynb`: The jupyter notebook used to generate the PDB and SDF files for each guest using OpenEye toolkits and the SMILES strings and codenames found in `guests.txt`.
