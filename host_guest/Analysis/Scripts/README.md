# SAMPL7 host-guest analysis scripts

## Manifest
- `analyze_hostguest.py`: Master analysis script, based on SAMPL6 host-guest analysis script from Andrea Rizzi.
- `get_usermap.py`: Should be run before `analyze_hostguest.py`; obtains and stores "user map" (really more of a submission map) which lists submission IDs and corresponding file names.
