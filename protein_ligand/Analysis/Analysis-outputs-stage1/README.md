# SAMPL7 protein-ligand (PHIP2) stage 1  analysis

- Scripts: Python scripts used to analyze the submissions
- Submissions-stage1: Participant submissions for stage 1, including detailed method descriptions.
- Submissions-stage2: Participant submissions for stage 2, including detailed method descriptions and predicted poses, in .tar.gz files.
- `SAMPL7-user-map-PL.csv`: PHIP2 submissions/names, as generated by `get_usermap.py` script in `Scripts` from submission manifest
- Analyses were generated by executing `bash run.sh` in the `/Scripts` directory
- The script generates confusion matrices for all submission at each site individually and groups the results for `ranked`, `non-ranked` and `ranked_and_non-ranked` submissions 
- The predictions are bootstrapped to evaluate the possible error within each submission
- The balanced accuracies and precision scores are barplotted from the confusion matrices
