# Example PHIP2 Stage 2 submission

This contains preparation and submission files for a PHIP2 stage 2 docking submission (this one utilizing the OpenEye toolkits). This provides an example of the correct submission format. The provided files may serve as a reference submission as well (to be determined).

A related example, showing screening of the PHIP2 Stage 1 fragments, can be found in the latter part of [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/MobleyLab/drug-computing/blob/master/uci-pharmsci/lectures/docking_scoring_pose/OEDocking.ipynb).

## Manifest

- `generate_results`: Directory containing tools for generating pose predictions
- `generate_results/poses`: Directory containing results to be submitted
- `PHIP2_2-poses.tar.gz`: Compressed, archived version of `generate_results/poses` directory, suitable for submission to server. **This serves as an example corresponding to an acceptable submission.**
